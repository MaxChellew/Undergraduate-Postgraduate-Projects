# FX Derivatives Market Maker Experiment

In this third-year university project for Trading, Market Design & Application, I simulate the role of an FX market maker using Excel. I attempt to quote FX forward and option contracts, assess spot delta risk exposure, perform delta hedging, and explain portfolio PnL through basic Greeks summation. The accompanying Technical Report describes the experiments process and discusses my findings. Please download the Excel file for the experiments outcome and see the PDF file for the detailed Technical Report.
